# COGNITEX_PROJECT_II
## About
COGNITEX is an intelligent cognitive load–adaptive platform that monitors user behavior in real time to detect mental workload without using sensors. Using machine learning, Agentic AI, and Generative AI, it automatically adjusts task difficulty, recommends breaks, and provides personalized learning or work assistance. The system aims to reduce cognitive overload, improve engagement, and enhance productivity in both educational and professional environments.

## Introduction
AI-driven learning systems are transforming education by adapting content based on learner behavior and performance.Cognitive Load Theory helps balance mental effort to improve understanding and retention during learning.Machine Learning and Generative AI enable real-time analysis and personalized learning interventions.Adaptive intelligent tutoring systems enhance engagement, reduce overload, and improve overall learning outcomes.

## Results

The COGNITEX system successfully detected three cognitive states—Overload, Optimal, and Underload—using behavioral indicators such as typing speed, errors, and inactivity.

In Overload, the system reduced difficulty and suggested a break.

In Optimal, it maintained the current learning pace.

In Underload, it increased task difficulty to improve engagement.

This confirms real-time adaptive learning based on cognitive state detection.

## Conclusion

COGNITEX effectively uses Agentic AI and Generative AI to autonomously monitor mental workload and dynamically adjust learning strategies. The system ensures balanced learning by preventing overload, avoiding boredom, and maintaining optimal engagement.
